## Process of Table 1 Replication
For the process of recreating table 1 of this paper, 
I separated the data into two separate matrices where matrix 1 had 
all of the tweets that were labeled false and the other matrix 
had all the tweets that were labeled true. Next, I identified the columns
that matched the individual rows in the original feature column
and then ran the ks.test function provided by R
where each sample was from the same column but different matrices.
(i.e. num_retweets from False and num_retweets from True) I assumed 
that the same two sided greater than hyptohesis for their test but 
realized that they used a combination of both less than and greater
than for their two sided hypothesis when conducting the test.
The thing that I chose to vary in this reproduction was the actual 
Kolmogorov Smirnov Test, in the paper the authors said they ran the 
actual test which I interpreted as them coding the test and running it
but I just called an R function. I assumed that this 
didn't matter and found that it didn't because we got the same results.
