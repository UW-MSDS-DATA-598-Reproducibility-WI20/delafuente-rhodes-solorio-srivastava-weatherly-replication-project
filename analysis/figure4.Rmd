## Process of Figure 4 Replication

Figure 4 was a relatively simple figure to replicate. Using the supporting figure description, x-axis title and y-axis title, it was fairly straightforward when it came to replication. Figure 4 depicts a histogram of all of the tweets in the dataset, binned by the number of hashtags they contained and split into two groups, Fake News and Other. The y-axis corresponds to the percentage of tweets of that group (Fake News or Other) fell into that specific bin of number of hashtags. It was easily to then apply ggplot and geom_histogram functions on the dataset to get an almost identical figure to the one produced in the paper. Since the style of the two figures are slightly differing, it is proably safe to assume that the authors of the paper used different or additional libraries to generate Figure 4.
