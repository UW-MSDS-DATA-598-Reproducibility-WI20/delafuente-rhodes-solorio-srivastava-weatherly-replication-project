The following is the author's description of their data:
For this study, we collected publicly available tweets using Twitter’s public API. Given the nature of the data, it is important to emphasize that such tweets are subject to Twitter’s terms and conditions which indicate that users consent to
the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, and disclosure of data. Therefore, we do not expect ethical, legal, or social implications from the usage of the tweets. Our data was collected using search terms related to the presidential election held in the United States on November 8th 2016. Particularly, we queried Twitter’s streaming API, more precisely the ﬁlter endpoint of the streaming API, using the following hashtags and user handles: #MyVote2016, #ElectionDay, #electionnight, @realDonaldTrump and @HillaryClinton. The data collection ran for just one day (Nov 8th 2016). One straightforward way of sharing information on Twitter is by using the retweet functionality, which enables a user to share a exact copy of a tweet with his followers. Among the reasons for retweeting, Body et al.16 reported the will to: 1) spread tweets to a new audience, 2) to show one’s role as a listener, and 3) to agree with someone or validate the thoughts of others. As indicated, our initial interest is to characterize tweets containing fake news that went viral (as they are the most harmful ones, as they reach a wider audience), and understand how it diﬀers from other viral tweets (that do not contain fake news). For our study, we consider that a tweet went viral if it was retweeted more than 1000 times. Once we have the dataset of viral tweets, we eliminated duplicates (some of the tweets were collected several times because they had several handles) and an expert manually inspected the text ﬁeld within the tweets to label them as containing fake news, or not containing them (according to the characterization presented before). This annotated dataset9 is publicly available and can be freely reused. Finally, we use the following ﬁelds within tweets (from the ones returned by Twitter’s API) to compare their distributions and look for diﬀerences between viral tweets containing fake news and viral tweets not containing fake news:

• Exposure: created at, retweet count, favourites count and hashtags.
• Characterization. screen name, verified, urls, followers count, friends count and media.
• Polarization. text and hashtags
